/**
 * This package provides the common tag-related classes that are used across the project.
 *
 * <p>The most important classes to take in count would be {@link com.saicone.nbt.TagMapper} to
 * handle any NBT implementation or java objects itself and also {@link com.saicone.nbt.TagType} to
 * identify common tag types information.
